# Python Developer Test 2: FFmpeg and Pillow

## Objective
This script generates a short video from an image using FFmpeg and Pillow. It overlays text onto the image, applies a basic transformation (grayscale, rotation, or resize), and then converts it into a short video clip with background music.

## Features
- **Image Processing:**  
  - Load an image and overlay custom text.
  - Apply basic transformations: grayscale, rotation, or resize.
- **Video Generation:**  
  - Convert the processed image into a video using FFmpeg.
  - Overlay background music on the video.
- **Configurability:**  
  - Easily modify text overlay and transformation type.
  - Customize file inputs for the image and background music.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **FFmpeg** ([Download here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html))
- **Pillow** (Python package)
  ```sh
  pip install pillow

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   https://github.com/pranjali-22/Image-to-Video.git
   cd Image-to-Video
2. **Run the script**
   ```sh
    python script.py
### Output Generated
A user can input the type of transformation that they want to applyâ€”such as grayscale, rotation, or resizing. Based on the input, two files will be generated:
1. **output.jpg:** The image with the applied transformation.
2. **output.mp4:** A short video generated using the processed image and the background music.
